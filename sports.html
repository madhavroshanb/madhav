                <p>A loincloth and a mud pit wasn't where I imagined I would find myself. But there I was, in a traditional Indian mud wrestling competition (Dangal), held in an Akhada. A very far cry from the sanitized jiu jitsu halls of Vienna, with their coaches holding timers, it was exhilerating to test my boundaries and communication skills. I explored cultural differences in approaches to combat, and traditions surrounding martial arts. Through this experience, I helped build the grit and mental fortitude that I now bring to every activity I take part in: from Entrepreneurship to studying for an exam.</p>

                <p>I'm incredibly grateful that I chose to start grappling. Over these years, training 5x a week, I've been able to step so far outside of my comfort zone that it's changed who I am as a person. Unlike in America, Youth grappling clubs aren't really a thing in Vienna. That's why I've always had to push, training against adults who are stronger and heavier than me, perfecting my technique to the point where I'm now confident going against most untrained adults. Stress inoculation, self-defence skills and the lifelong friendships that come from being squished by a powerlifter who weighs twice as much as you - I would recommend BJJ and Judo to everyone.</p>

                <p>3 nights, 4 days. Unsupervised, unshowered, carrying 25 kilo backpacks. Sleeping under the stars, reading physical maps (electronics lead to immediate disqualification). Cooking on camping stoves, and keeping each other going to cover over 100k by the time we were done. The Duke programme is not for the faint-hearted. But if I can lead a group of tired, annoyed, sweaty teens who hate each other through a 4 day hike, I can lead anyone.</p>

                <p>Basketball took me from a child to a young adult. The sense of purpose I got from training every week, waking up at 5 before school every day the whole year, taught me what it means to try your absolute hardest. I learned discipline and developed physical skills that opened doors to so many things, like BJJ, Judo, and the gym, and everything downstream of that. The crowning achievement of my (short) career was winning the Austria-Wide U16 under-playoffs with my club team, the Basket Flames.</p>
